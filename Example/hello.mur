// This is a commentary, the script will ignore these lines

@include: [Declarations] // This is how you include more files

@init:
	//This runs immediately when the file is loaded
	variable = [Hello]
	result = [number ] + (2 + 2)

#init
	// The game starts here!
    {variable} world!
    This is MurMur and it has a bunch of features.
    {menu:[Do you want to know more?]}
    	{option:[Can you use conditionals?]}
    		{goto:[if_else]}
		{option:[Can you do operations?]}
			{goto:[operations]}
		{option:[Do I need to use a goto in these options?]}
			Nope, you can just keep typing things inside this block.
		{end}
	After the "goto" is done, the code will jump back here
	Bye now!

#if_else
	Absolutely! You can have a if block like now.
	{if:true}
		This always appears.
	{else}
		This never happens.
	{end}
	{myVar = [banana]}
	Or even something like this {if:myVar==[avocado]}won't show up{else}will show up{end} in the middle of the sentence!

#operations
	Two plus two equals {result}. // Remember? We declared this in the @init block
	And you can even do math on the fly like this: {8/2 + 4}.
	You can also append strings {[this is a ] + [string]}
